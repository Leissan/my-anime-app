# My Anime List App
### Introduction

This should be an exciting app for those into Anime! It is a single page application which includes many different concepts I have learned so far, such as:
- Javascript variables
- working with arrays and objects
- arrow and callback functions
- creating  webpage using HTML and CSS
- DOM manipulation and event listeners
- using fetch() and JSON to communicate with public API

>You will be using the free open API.
>No API key or authentication is required for the endpoints we will be using.

### Description
- When you open up an app, you will see a list of al available animes 
- This app will be interactive, because you will be able to click into each name of the anime which will load its image, storyline, score, number of episodes, rating, and a direct link to more information
- Once you learn more about each anime, you will be able to click the button "I want to watch this!" which will create a reminder pop-up proclaiming "lets put this on a to-watch list!"
- The pop-up message will disappear after 3 seconds
- You will be able to go back to the list of all animes by clicking the button "All Animes" on top of the page
